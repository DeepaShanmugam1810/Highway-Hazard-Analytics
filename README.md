# Highway-Hazard-Analytics

Highway hazard analytics is a crucial application of data science that aims to improve road safety by analyzing accident data. Utilizing data from the UK, this project focuses on creating a Power BI dashboard to visualize and interpret accident statistics, ultimately guiding safety measures and policy decisions.

Project Overview:

The project begins with collecting accident data from various sources across the UK. This data typically includes information such as accident locations, severity, time of occurrence, weather conditions, and contributing factors. The data is then cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Data Processing:

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. Geographic information is integrated to map accident locations accurately. Data is also categorized into relevant variables like accident severity (minor, serious, fatal), road type, and weather conditions.

Power BI Dashboard Creation:

The core of this project is the development of a Power BI dashboard. Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, allows for the creation of interactive and intuitive reports. Key features of the dashboard include:

Interactive Maps: Display accident locations on a geographic map to identify high-risk areas and trends.
Trend Analysis: Show trends over time, highlighting peaks in accidents and correlating them with factors like weather conditions or specific times of day.
Severity Breakdown: Provide a breakdown of accident severity by location, time, and contributing factors.
Heatmaps: Generate heatmaps to visualize accident density and identify hazardous zones that require attention.
Benefits:

The Power BI dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making by providing a clear, visual representation of accident data. Authorities can use these insights to implement targeted safety measures, such as improving road infrastructure in high-risk areas or adjusting traffic regulations. The dashboard also supports ongoing monitoring and evaluation of road safety interventions, helping to ensure continuous improvement.

In summary, highway hazard analytics using accident data and Power BI dashboards offers a robust method for enhancing road safety. By transforming complex data into actionable insights, this approach supports more effective safety strategies and contributes to reducing accidents and improving overall road safety.
